    "description": "Hi, I'm Aflah, a research software engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. My work centers on deepening our understanding of large language models (LLMs) and rigorously evaluating their capabilities. I'm also passionate about the systems side of LLMs, with hands-on experience in large-scale pretraining and inference. In the past, I've contributed to projects targeting hate speech reduction and other NLP applications for social good.",
